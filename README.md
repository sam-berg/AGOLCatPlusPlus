AGOLCat++ is, at the moment, a developer sample utility to visualize the contents of the spreadsheet returned from an AGOLCat query: https://github.com/sam-berg/ago-tools/blob/master/samples/AGOLCat.py.

Copy and paste the spreadsheet into the browser window of this application to view the results as items.

Note you can also experiment with pasting the the results of a JSON query against a portal:
