AGOLCat++ is, at the moment, a developer sample utility to visualize the contents of the spreadsheet returned from an AGOLCat query: https://github.com/sam-berg/ago-tools/blob/master/samples/AGOLCat.py.

Copy and paste the spreadsheet into the browser window of this application to view the results as items.

Note you can also experiment with pasting the the results of a JSON query against a portal:

This map shows surface  water flow as a linear phenomenon even over and through bodies of  water.  Using the best available data we show relative flow accurately,  so that if one river carries more water downstream than another river,  the result will be that the river will have a thicker symbol on the map.</span></span></span></span></p><p>This  map is used as an overlay for content such as elevation from the World  Terrain Base service or thematic services such as soil units,  vegetation, or ecoregions. Combined with a basemap and your map  services, this map provides a frame of reference for showing regional,  national, and continental hydrologic phenomena such as drought, runoff,  river level monitoring and flood forecasting.</p><p>River  names are collected in the UTF8 character set, so river names are  collected in their original language, but are written in the Roman  alphabet.  Sources for all river names are from the open source  geonames.org project so they are international by nature.<br /></p><p>The  map is compiled from several sources.  The global scales (very small  scales through 1:2,300,000) include content from: HydroSHEDS, GTOPO30  Global Topographic Data, SRTM, GLWD, WorldClim, GRDC, and WWF Global 200  Terrestrial Eco Regions, with the latter three providing the inputs and  basis for calculating flow.  At medium scales (1:36,000 to 1:2,000,000)  this service currently contains only U.S. data and that was derived  from the NHDPlus program that was jointly produced by the USGS, EPA, and  Horizon Systems. <br /></p><p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin'></span>  </p></span></span></font><p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height: normal'><img alt='Description: http://downloads.esri.com/blogs/arcgisonline/esrilogo_new.png' src='http://downloads.esri.com/blogs/arcgisonline/esrilogo_new.png' /><span style='font-size:10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin'><br /></span></p><p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height: normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin'>This work is licensed under the Web Services and API Terms of Use. <br /> </span><a href='http://links.esri.com/e800-summary' target='_blank'><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin'>View Summary</span></b></a><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin'> | </span><a href='http://www.esri.com/legal/pdfs/e-800-termsofuse.pdf' target='_blank'><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin'>View Terms of Use</span></b></a><span><b><span style='font-size: 10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin'></span></b></span></p>  <p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height: normal'><img alt='World Wildlife Fund' src='http://downloads.esri.com/blogs/hydro/WWF/WWFPanda.jpg' /> <span style='color: rgb(0, 0, 0);'><span style='font-size: large;'><span style='font-weight: bold;'><a href='http://hydrosheds.cr.usgs.gov/' target='_blank'>HydroSHEDS</a></span></span></span></p><p style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height: normal'>This product, the World Hydro Reference Overlay, incorporates data from the HydroSHEDS database which is © World Wildlife Fund, Inc.

The service currently provides coverage for the world down to a scale of ~1:1m and coverage for the continental United States and Hawaii to a scale of ~1:70k.</p><p>This service is intended primarily for overlaying on these basemap services: <a href='http://www.arcgisonline.com/home/item.html?id=c61ad8ab017d49e1a82f580ee1298931' target='_blank'>World Terrain Base</a>, <a href='http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=9c5370d0b54f4de1b48a3792d7377ff2' target='_self'>World Shaded Relief</a> and <a href='http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=c4ec722a1cd34cf0a23904aadf8923a0' target='_self'>World Physical Map</a>.  </p><p>If you are using ArcMap, this service doesn't draw correctly unless you are using 9.3.1 or more recent because it is cached using the PNG32 graphic format, which isn't supported in ArcMap prior to 9.3.1.

            "description": "As of July 2011, the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System protects 12,598 miles of 203 rivers in 38 states and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; this is a little more than one-quarter of one percent of the nation's rivers. By comparison, more than 75,000 large dams across the country have modified at least 600,000 miles, or about 17%, of American rivers.  <br /><br />National Wild and Scenic Rivers may be designated by Congress or the Secretary of the Interior. Designation neither prohibits development nor gives the federal government control over private property. Recreation, agricultural practices, residential development, and other uses may continue. Protection of the river is provided through voluntary stewardship by landowners and river users and through regulation and programs of federal, state, local, or tribal governments.  <br /><br />In 1995, the Interagency Wild &amp; Scenic Rivers Coordinating Council Charter was established to improve interagency coordination in administering the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, thereby improving service to the American public and enhancing protection of important river resources. The Council consists of representatives of the four wild and scenic rivers administering agencies—the Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and U.S. Forest Service.  <br /><br />These data were developed to provide a representation of the National Wild and Scenic River system of the continental United States. The original National Wild and Scenic River system dataset was compiled by the USGS National Atlas in 2000. The source data is 1:2,000,000 scale stream segment data compiled from a variety of sources. New segments added to the system since 2000 were obtained and compiled at 1:24,000 scale.  <br /><br />For more information, visit: http://www.rivers.gov/",
